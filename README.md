# HC-SR04-Driver-for-MSP432
This driver will allow you to integrate an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor with an MSP432 microcontroller. The code should be easily edited to fit other TI microcontrollers if need be. 
The code is commented well enough that you should be able to easily change the I/O pins and timers to fit your needs.
